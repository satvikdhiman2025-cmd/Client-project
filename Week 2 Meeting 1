We decided to get together and research backend coding as well as efficient methods of data saving. 

We found that using a server or database will improve: organization, user accessability, and allow us to update our information easier.

We found that Django and Flask are backend languages that pair well with python, and we're looking into different ways to utilize these backend languages in our project
