Agenda: Now that we've tested both Flask and Django prototypes, our next step is to analyze results and begin shaping the foundation of the final patient information system. 

Discussion points: 
1. Review findings from last weeks prototype testing.
2. Decide on final backend framework to continue developement.
3. Discuss any technical challeneges faced during testing and possible solutions. 

This weeks focus: 
1. Begin building the core database scheme for storing patient data.
2. Create an improved UI for adding and viewing patient records. 
3. Start setting up user authentication and basic access control.
